## At first, some terminology:

### Processes in UNIX
### Definition:
A process is an instance of a program that is being executed. Each process has its own address space, memory, and resources allocated by the operating system.

### Key Attributes of a Process:
**Process ID (PID)**: A unique identifier assigned to each process.
**Parent Process ID (PPID)**: The PID of the process that created (or spawned) this process.
**User and Group ID**: Identifiers indicating the user and group ownership of the process.
**Process State**: The current state of the process (running, sleeping, stopped, etc.).
**Memory Layout**: Includes the stack, heap, text (code), and data segments.

### Examples of Processes:
A web server (e.g., **httpd** or **nginx**)
A shell (e.g., **bash** or **zsh**)
A user application (e.g., a text editor like vim)
